To get the IP we used the following function --> {:ok,z}=:inet.getif()
Assuming the OS on UF server is Linux, we are extracting the first values in the :inet.getif(). For other OS the program may not work as the IP address can
be in a different tuple.

Implementation Details:

1.	WORK UNIT
	The string generation method is random. We create a list for upper-case characters, lower-case characters, numbers and special characters each and shuffle it
	4 times. Then we take 5 random strings from the shuffled list and concatenate it with the given string "kdesai261;". It is also iterative as we concatenate the
	count value which increases every iteration.
		We decided to use an iterative approach combined with random approach for the following reasons:
		a) iterative approach ensures that there are no duplicates
		b) random string ensures that two processes may not reach at the same string value. 
		
	1000 processes are created for Bitcoin mining, any further increase in number of processes gives no performance improvement.


2.	The result of running our program for 4 zeroes

	We were able to mine 84 coins with 4 leading zeroes in 10 minutes among which 6 coins had 5 leading zeroes and 1 with 6 leading zeroes

	(Total CPU time)/(Number of CPUs) would be same as elapsed real time if the work load is evenly distributed on each CPU and no wait is involved for I/O or other resources.
	Here, 
		Total CPU time = 1m56.291s + 0m2.498s = 1m58.789s = 118.789s
		Real Time = 33.733s
		The ratio of CPU time to real time = 3.52
	
	We were able to mine 16 coins with 5 leading zeroes in 10 minutes among which 2 coins had 6 leading zeroes.
	
4. 	The coin with the most zeroes we managed to find is 8.
	To increase the chances of getting 8 leading zeroes, we are using 32 random characters after the given string(kdesai261;)

5. 	The largest number of working machines we were able to run our code with is 5 - 4 miners and 1 master.
